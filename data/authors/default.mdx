## Hello, folks! 👋 I'm Marshal

I have a passion for **JavaScript/Dart** and Mobile development.
I'm currently a freelancer Mobile developer (I'm also looking for a full-time job). I work mainly with **Javascript**, **Kotlin**, **React Native**, **NodeJS**, **Flutter** and **Dart**.

## Why have this blog?

> My journey is fueled by a deep desire to sharpen my abilities and share the insights I’ve gathered along the way.

I founded this blog as a means to document and share the knowledge and practical wisdom I've acquired during my journey as a software engineer.

Writing and taking notes helps me solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies. I hope my blog can be a useful resource for fellow web developers.

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and comments on what I have written 🍻.

## Tech stack

This blog is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

This blog site takes inspiration from [aka Karhdo](https://https://karhdo.dev). I appreciate [aka Karhdo](https://twitter.com/karhdo) and [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for their contribution to this minimal, lightweight, and highly customizable blog starter.

A few major over-engineering-changes from the original repo:

- 📌 Upgrading to **React 18**, **Next 15**.

- 📌 Adopting **Typescript**, committing with
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

- 📌 Monitoring site with [Umami](https://umami.is/)
  website analytics

- 📌 My website refers to the design
  from the [aka Karhdo](https://github.com/Karhdo/karhdo.dev) repository and incorporates the
  tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog template, version 2.0.

- 📌 Bumping up `mdx-bundler`, `rehype`/`remark`
  plugins and dependencies to the latest version

🧐See my [repository](https://github.com/) for this blog.
